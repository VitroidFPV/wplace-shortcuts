# WPlace Shortcuts
A very simple userscript for WPlace drawing, allowing you to use keyboard shortcuts to select colors.

Double tap `C` followed by number keys to select a color of that number in the list. Only works in painting mode.

If you have Tampermonkey installed, you can install the userscript from this link:
